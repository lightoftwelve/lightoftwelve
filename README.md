## About Me 

🚀 As a spirited entrepreneur with a rich 15-year journey in UI/UX design, I've now embraced the exciting world of full-stack development. My tech adventure started in Telecommunications Engineering and web development as a leisure pursuit. This path ignited my entrepreneurial spirit, leading to successful ventures in real estate, e-commerce, and software development, creating job opportunities for many others along the way.

💡 Presently, I'm steering the ship as the CTO & Co-Founder of [**Write Guide AI**](https://writeguide.ai), where we innovate in AI-driven article and social media content generation, giving business owners and hobbyists the opportunity to free up their time by letting Write Guide AI write blogs and social media content for them! Simultaneously, I am the CEO & Founder [**Light of Twelve**](https://www.lightoftwelve.com), a unique global gemstone and mineral enterprise. Here, I blend my love for storytelling with spirituality, tarot, astrology, crystal healing, and more, crafting compelling narratives for our audience.

I'm at my best when tackling complex challenges in fast-paced environments, finding great satisfaction in exceeding expectations. This passion fuels my growing interest in full-stack development, adding a new dimension to my skill set. Alongside technical prowess, I bring expertise in project management, business planning, e-commerce, SEO optimization, import/export, and real estate investment.

Join me on this journey as I continue to explore the intersection of technology, creativity, and business acumen, always aiming to push boundaries and inspire innovation.
